## Feature Requests
- RigidBody2D https://bsky.app/profile/atropos148.bsky.social/post/3ljhccxiiyc2g
- Tangle system: https://bsky.app/profile/smitner.studio/post/3ljiul5ioqc2o
- Elasticity: https://bsky.app/profile/brinegame.bsky.social/post/3ljgyh6d5lc2x

## Physics
- Implement optional collisions
- Implement optional tangle system
## Visual
- Figure out graphics to make more realistic, perhaps a gradient? 
## Interaction
- Option to disable either anchor
- Always allow drag of rope, no need for anchors
- Get rid of anchor debug and display, just allow the user to drag rope directly
## General
- Turn into plugin
- Fix errors that pop up when creating pixelrope
- Change terms for anchors and pins
- Create install instructions, both text and video
- Reorganise properties in inspector
- Remove anchor interaction mode while in-game, only need that for the editor, don't even need it, just 
- Make it so you can move the debug anchors and have the line automatically update while in-editor

# Completed Tasks
- Change to MPL 2.0 license
- Create example scene
- Use anchor position from editor instead of hardcoded in PixelRope
- Display rope in-editor while moving anchors
- Add option to disable kinematic on EndAnchor
